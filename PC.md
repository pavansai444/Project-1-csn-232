# Producer-Consumer problem 
The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical multi process synchronization problem,There are more than one Producer in this, Producer is producing some items, whereas there is more than one Consumers that is consuming the items produced by the Producer. The same memory buffer is shared by both producers and consumers.The producer should produce data only when the buffer is not full and the data can only be consumed by Consumer when buffer is not empty.Producer and Consumer are not allowed to access the same memory buffer at same time.
